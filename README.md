# AppTestiaTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.14.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running Electron

Run `npm run start:electron` to launch the app wrapped in Electron. A window will open automatically.

## Build the Electron executable

Run `npm run make` to build the electron app executable. This will build an `out/` folder at the root level of your project. Inside this folder is the executable. Please note that the `dist/` folder is needed to build the executable.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
